    """The summary line for a class docstring should fit on one line.

    If the class has public attributes, they may be documented here
    in an ``Attributes`` section and follow the same formatting as a
    function's ``Args`` section. Alternatively, attributes may be documented
    inline with the attribute's declaration (see __init__ method below).

    Properties created with the ``@property`` decorator should be documented
    in the property's getter method.

    Attributes
    ----------
    attr1 : str
        Description of `attr1`.
    attr2 : :obj:`int`, optional
        Description of `attr2`.

        The __init__ method may be documented in either the class level
        docstring, or as a docstring on the __init__ method itself.

        Either form is acceptable, but the two should not be mixed. Choose one
        convention to document the __init__ method and be consistent with it.

        Note
        ----
        Do not include the `self` parameter in the ``Parameters`` section.

        Parameters
        ----------

        param2 : :obj:`list` of :obj:`str`
